## Thème : Algo et mathématique (la vie de Alan Turing)
	Alan Mathison Turing, bornJune 23, 1912in London and died onJune 7, 1954in Wilmslow, 
	is a British mathematician and cryptologist, author of works which scientifically found computer science.
	
	To solve the fundamental problem of decidability in arithmetic, he presented in 1936 a thought experiment 
	that would later be called the Turing machine and the concepts of programs and programming, which would take 
	on their full meaning with the spread of computers, in the second half of the 20th century. 
	
	His model helped establish Church's thesis, which defines the intuitive mathematical concept of computable function.

### Test 1: Decrypt me if you can
	Ce message codé est vraiment difficile à décoder, 
	mais comme attendu de la part du grand Alan Turing, 
	tu as réussi à le décrypté, donc la réponse est 23         
	(message crypté avec des lettres d’écart).

### Test 2: Crossword

### Test 3: Calculate me if you can
	19 * 5 + 7 / 6  = 17
	(X * 5 + 7) / 6 = 17
	(12 * 8 – 31) / 64/8 = 8.125
	(Y * 8 – 31) / 64/8 = 8.125
	Concat(X, Y) ;
